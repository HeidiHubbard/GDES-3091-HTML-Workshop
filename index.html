                    Sir Winston Newton Lord Beaverbrook III, or Winston for
                    short, is a Canadian Chocolate Point Siamese cat born April
                    17th, 2019 in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada. He is known for
                    being the goodest and most fluffy boy to have ever lived.

                    Winston was one of a litter of six born in a sock drawer to
                    a domestic cat named Milton. He has an older biological
                    sister named Poppy, whom he lives with in Toronto, Ontario,
                    Canada along with his adoptive parents Heidi and Hunter.

                    Winston is a perpetrator of catfishing. When he was born, he
                    was a luscious snow-white boy with black extremities. Since
                    then, he has "metamorphosed" into a darker, brown coat. This
                    change in coat color (and siamese's unique markings in
                    general) are due to a mutation in the protein tyrosinase.
                    Tyrosinase is responsible for making melanin, the pigment in
                    fur. This mutation in the protein in Siamese cats causes it
                    to work best at room temperature, roughly 25&deg;C. However,
                    temperatures in the womb are much warmer. Therefore, the
                    melanin is blocked from making fur pigmentation during
                    gestation. When Siamese kittens are born, they are stark
                    white. However, when their bodies begin to acclimate to the
                    temperatures of the outside world, they begin to turn brown
                    as their body temperature cools, allowing tyrosinase to make
                    melanin and therefore fur pigmentation. Winston is a literal
                    shapeshifter.

                    Since the day he was born, Winston has been on a mission to
                    live his best life. Though he is good at heart, he is driven
                    by his curiosity and can't help but get into trouble. A
                    notorious plant-killer, glass-spiller and bird-stalker, he
                    is on the prowl day and night just causing ruckus wherever
                    and whenever he can without a heck to give. Most recently,
                    Winston was given a door-hang mouse to keep him entertained
                    and out of trouble, which he proceeded to eat whole. This
                    resulted in a 3 a.m. trip to the emergency vet and a hefty
                    bill. Winston refuses to be tamed.

                    Winston is a jack of many trades. Some of his favourite
                    hobbies include sleeping, grooming, purring, stalking birds,
                    chewing on plastic, zooming back and forth between rooms,
                    playing fetch, digging in plant pots, eating tuna, and
                    scratching furniture.

                <p>
                    In the future, Winston hopes to become a successful hunter
                    in the unforgiving Canadian wilderness. He has dedicated his
                    life to studying wildlife, spending many hours daily
                    watching 50 hour long loop youtube videos of birds on TV.
                    One day, when he does not live on the 57th floor of an
                    apartment complex, he will bolt into the great outdoors the
                    first chance he gets and achieve his dream of galavanting
                    among the birds, squirrels and mice, bringing back many
                    feasts for his fellow family members. He hopes to be
                    crowned the most successful bird hunter to have ever lived.
